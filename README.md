# Finder ln #

Finder ln (as in the Unix ln command) is comprised of two OSX workflow scripts that allow you to conveniently create Unix-based hard and symbolic links directly within the OSX Finder application.

## Requirements ##

OSX 10.6+

## Installation ##

A zipped version of the two bundles (*Hard Link.workflow* and *Symbolic Link.workflow*) can be [downloaded](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1024276/damosworld/Finder%20ln.zip).  Double click the downloaded zip file to unzip, and then double click each of the .workflow bundle files to install them on your Mac.  Once installed, they are automatically added to the *Services* menu for Finder.

## Usage ##

To create hard links to one or more files, select the files with Finder, click on the *Finder* menu and choose *Services*, then select *Hard Link*. A dialog will appear asking for a destination folder to hard link the file(s).  Similarly, to create symbolic links or files and/or folders, select them with Finder, click on the *Finder* menu and choose *Services*, then select *Symbolic Link*.
